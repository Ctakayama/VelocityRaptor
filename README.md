## Getting started

Make sure you have npm installed. If you do not, download [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Clone the repository and download dependencies by running
### `npm install`

***

### `npm run build`

It will build the app by compiling the typescript files into javascript files and recursively placing them into the `src/js` directory.
